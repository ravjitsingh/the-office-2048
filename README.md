# The Office 2048
A small clone of [2048](https://play2048.co) (which, in turn, was inspired by [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024)), based on the hit American TV show, **The Office**.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://www.theoffice2048.com/)

**Important note:** This game is made just for fun and neither affliated to NBC nor aims to make any kind of money off of The Office IP.

### Contributions

This game is based on the original [2048](https://play2048.co) so shout out to [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli) for making it free and open source. And since the orignal one had important contributions from a bunch of contributors, shout out to each of them too!

All the GIFs are sourced from [Giphy](https://giphy.com). [EZGIF](https://ezgif.com) is an amazing website that helped me in editing and optimising the GIFs for a smooth experience.

The cookie information dialogue used is a free-to-use JavaScript plug-in developed by [Jo√£o Pereira](http://joaopereira.pt) called cookieBubble.

## Donations
I worked on this game in my free time, and since it's hosted on GitHub, I don't have any hosting costs. But if you enjoyed the game, you'd probably want to check out my other [projects](#) or just [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ravjit)! Thank you very much!
